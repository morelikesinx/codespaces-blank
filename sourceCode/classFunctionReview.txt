Was it easy to find your classmates assignment?

'It was very easy to find my classmate's assignment. All I needed was to find and click his repo'

Was their documentation clear and concise on what their program was designed to do?

Yes, their documentation was clear and concise on what their program does.

Was their documnetion clear and concise on how to install their program?

No. There was no installment process instructions.

When you installed and ran your classmates program, did it work as described?

No. The program did not work as intended. No matter if I type 'yes' and 'no', I still get the same result.
Based on your experience using your classmate's program, as well as what you've learned about programming and documentation, 
are there any reccomendations that you would provide to your classmate?

I would suggest that they remove the booleans they added next to the if/else/elif statements,
as I may be the reason for why it outputs two results of both if/else statements
no matter my answer of 'yes' and 'no'
